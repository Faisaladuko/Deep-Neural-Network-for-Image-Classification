# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification

This was the last programming assignment of Week 4, and also the last programming assignment of Andrew Yang Deep learning course 

This is a cat/not-a-cat classifier, built using a deep network. TThere an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression implementation.  

I Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning
